    <h3>60 Day FDA Vape Deadline Passes
</h3>
<h5>Adina Karp</h5>
<h6>December 13, 2018</h6>
   
      <p>Joe Camel was suave in his time, but if he was handed the sleek rechargeable grey and black stick that has attachable flavors, he probably wouldn't know what do with it. But highschool students — well, that’s a different story.</p>
      <p>
      	On September 12 the FDA released a <a href=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-new-steps-address-epidemic-youth-e-cigarette-use target="_blank">statement</a> that addressed what they call the “epidemic” of youth e-cigarette use, explained the three pronged approach of their Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan, and announced the largest single enforcement action in agency history. In a coordinated initiative aimed at retail and online sales of e-cigarettes to minors, the FDA issued over 1,000 warnings to e-cigarette producers. The statement culminated in a request to the major manufacturers and brands of e-cigs, namely JUUL, Vuse, MarkTen, blu e-cigs, and Logic to come back to the FDA in 60 days with “robust plans” on how they plan to address the youth e-cig epidemic. Yesterday, December 12, was that 60 day deadline. 
      </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-ingredients-components/vaporizers-e-cigarettes-and-other-electronic-nicotine-delivery-systems-ends" target="_blank">FDA</a>, among middle and high school students, 3.62 million were current users of e-cigarettes in 2018. And, from 2017-2018 e-cigarette use among high school students increased 78 percent among high school students. Furthermore, according to a 2013-2014 survey 81 percent of youth e-cigarette users cited the availability of appealing flavors as the primary reason for use.</p>

      <p> Abby  is a first year student at The New School. She started vaping to give up smoking cigarettes, and she says the flavors that JUUL pods have really helped with the transition, and “if JUUL pods didn’t have flavors I would still be smoking cigarettes”. Molly started vaping just five months ago, but already she can’t imagine not, she vapes walking to school, with friends, in between class and she says “If I can get away with it, during class also”. Her favorite flavor is cucumber, but she used to like fruit medley. She plays with the sleek JUUL nervously, turning it over and over in her hand, fidgeting. Molly is 18. </p> 

      <p>The minimum age in New York State to buy electronic cigarettes and products is currently 18. However, municipalities can opt to enforce higher ages. According to the <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/tobacco_control/current_policies.htm" target="_">New York Department of Health</a>, by January 1, 2019 the minimum legal sale age will be 21. </p>

      <p>Many of the companies have posted official responses and action plans. The two largest suppliers, Blu and JUUL had different approaches.  Blu’s response admitted that more careful monitoring and regulation was required in terms of selling to minors, but that “ultimately many of these could hurt consumers in the long run and could affect how you the consumer buys blu products”. JUUL published an action plan outlining their plan to limit in-store availability of their flavors in stores, in order to try and limit youth exposure to the product. Another integral part of JUUL’s proposal is an upgrade of their website with verification of buyer age and identity through a multi-factor identification.</p>

We will be a transparent, engaged, and committed partner in this effort with FDA, state Attorneys General, local municipalities, and community organizations. We thank Commissioner Gottlieb for his ongoing leadership on this critical issue. JUUL Labs hopes the components of our plan are implemented industry-wide. If implemented across the category, these actions will have the greatest impact in restricting access and ultimately decreasing underage use, along with 21+ laws on all tobacco products."

	<p>But for Molly, none of these new restrictions has posed significant challenges to her. Molly has never had a problem obtaining the product. “I usually just go buy it the gas station,” said Molly. In response to the FDA notice JUUL has stopped selling their flavored pods in gas station, but now Molly just gets them online. “I just use my mom’s info for the verification, it’s really not that hard to get it”. And being in The Village for class daily has given Molly more access to e-cigs than ever before, “There are just so many smoke shops close by to class”, she said “and nobody really cares how old you are, or you can always just get someone to buy for you”. </p>

      <p>Smoke and vape shops are ubiquitous these days, and in the city,  due to community district caps for Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses that took effect April 26, 2018 “there are no licenses available in any community district” reports <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/description/electronic-cigarette-retail-dealer-license" target="_blank">NYC Business</a>. According to JUUL’s store locator, in the East  Village alone there are 37 authorized JUUL distributors</p>

      <p>There are too many smoke shops. There are too many smokers. Limiting retail licenses and making e-cigarette flavors less marketable to a younger crowd may be a start to combating these problem. But smoke, no matter how sweet smelling, always leads to fire.</p>
